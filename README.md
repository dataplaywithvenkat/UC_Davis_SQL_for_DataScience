## Retrieveing Data with select Statement
Need to specify two pieces of Information to use a select Statement: what you want and where you want to select it from.

```SQL
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products;
```

```SQL
SELECT prod_name,prod_id, prod_price
FROM Products;
```
(OR)

```SQL
SELECT prod_name,
        prod_id,
        prod_price
FROM Products;
```
